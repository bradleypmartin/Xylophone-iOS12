#  Xylophone

## My Goal

With this spike project (forked from London App Brewery), I'm going to play around with  AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer, making a toy xylophone app for iPhones. Neat!

## Things I'll be thinking about in this spike project

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* How to use tags in Interface Builder.
* Error handling using try and catch.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging for array index out of range errors.
